# Coffee Shop Challenge

## Overview
The **Coffee Shop Challenge** is a Python project developed for the SA Code Challenge. It implements a coffee shop domain model with three core classes: `Customer`, `Coffee`, and `Order`. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation, properties, relationships, and aggregate methods. It includes unit tests to verify functionality and a debug script for manual testing.

## Features

### Customer Class
- Manages customer names (1–15 characters, string).
- Tracks orders and unique coffees ordered.
- Supports creating new orders and finding the customer who spent the most on a specific coffee.

### Coffee Class
- Manages coffee names (≥3 characters, string, immutable).
- Tracks orders and unique customers.
- Calculates the number of orders and average order price.

### Order Class
- Links customers and coffees with a price (1.0–10.0, float, immutable).
- Provides access to customer and coffee instances.

### Relationships
- Customers can have multiple orders for different coffees.
- Coffees can be ordered by multiple customers.
- Orders connect one customer to one coffee with a specific price.

### Tests
- Comprehensive unit tests for all classes using `pytest`.

### Debug Script
- A script to manually test functionality and demonstrate relationships.
